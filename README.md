You will need Python 2.7 (preinstalled on OS X and some Linux (I think, don't know for sure, but I'm sure you can handle it)). If you're using Windows just go to https://www.python.org/ and get 2.7.

All you need to do then is navigate to the place where you uncompressed it, and type the following:

```
python history_generator.py
```

The simulation will then just run. Read the mechanics below for more information.
