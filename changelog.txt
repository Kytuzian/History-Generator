2016-12-31
Major changes:

Minor changes:
- Trade treaties now keep track of the money that each side has made.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed bug where treaties were not properly kept track of.
- Fixed bug where caravans influenced a cities religion before they actually got there.

2016-12-30
Major changes:
- Battles can now be run without graphics, which speeds up the rate at which
they run. Battles can also be run in "fast" mode--this greatly speeds up the
battle speed, but it also removes many features from the normal battles, so
you won't get the same results.

Minor changes:
- Notable people now have a religion, and their roles are affected by their religion (for example, a person who follows a religion that worships a prominent war god is more likely to be a general).
- Changed reloading speed to be simply the troop's discipline plus a random
either 0 or 1.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed a bug where art was trying to get a religion to base it's artwork off of.

2016-11-24
Major changes:
- Changed artists to have more of an identity, rather than just a random art producer. Artists can now switch professions, become specialized in producing a certain kind of art, or have a penchant for certain topics.
- Made nations' relations actually affect their likelihood of trading and going to war.
- Religions are now kept track of separately from nations, and nations can have a mix of religions in them.
    - New people born in a city have a random chance to be ANY religion, or even start a new religion.
    - Generally people will follow the religion of their own city, however.

Minor changes:
- Now all names generated by a nation's language will be remembered, so if an artist creates a work with any name from his language in it, it won't get re-translated.
- Improved the generator further (can now conjugate verbs).
- Added an information window for people.
- Simplified the displayed city name.
- Made relations changes make a little more sense (based on the amount per year, rather than just the straight amount).
- Notable people now live in a city, and will occasionally move around the world. This has no other effects at the moment.
- Writers will now sometimes write myths.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed the weighted random selector to like, actually handle the weights correctly (whoops).
- Sort of fixed bug where the game would crash while creating a new treaty.

2016-08-01
Major changes:
- Nations now all have a relations value for every other nation, which determines how hostile/accepting they are of that nation. This value is used for treaties and such.
- Added treaties to the game. Treaties, for now, simply provide an interface for the simulation to check how each treaty is developing, and use that information to determine the nations' relations.

Minor changes:
- Battle statistics now include deaths as well as kills.
- Added more descriptions/content to the various art forms.
- Took out abstract art for now--I want to improve it's subject/content generation before I put it back, and it needs a lot of reworking.
- WAY decreased frequency of holy wars (because every was at war with everybody, which is ridiculous).
- Changed the factors that affect starting trade agreements.
- Slightly tweaked some building values.
- Improved the string generator further (allowed custom tags to be added to a specific generator).

Bug fixes:
- Fixed issue with battle statistics where not all troop kills were counted.
- Fixed bug where the simulation would complain that it "cannot advance a negative amount of time" then attempt to do it anyway, causing an error.
- Various fixes to the art generation forms.
- Fixed bug where holy wars were not marked as actually being holy wars.

2016-07-28
Major changes:
- There is no longer just one stat. Now there is also an art creation rate (with others to come).
- Works of art will now sometimes have basic content (this is mostly for prophesies, but will be expanded upon later).
- Many changes to the string generation system to make it significantly more useful.
- If a nation is completely conquered, all of its notable people and art are now transferred to the conquering nation.

Minor changes:
- Added historians and allowed them to write works.
- Scientists can now write scientific essays.
- Oracles can now issue prophesies (currently do nothing).
- Each profession now has its own base art create chance (in addition to the randomization).
- The game will now store a list of all the battles fought including the location, belligerents, date, result, and statistics.
- Added some more options to the culture form generator (weapons, armor, battles, nations).
- The program now writes a more readable version of the event log (exactly the same stuff that appears in the console while the program is running).
- Increased name variety.
- Added an information GUI for individual pieces of art.
- Added a nation eliminated event.
- Note: Currently all art is registered as being "Lost". This is not actually the case, it's just due to not creating the system whereby art is actually stored in specific cities.

Bug fixes:
- Minor fixes to the art generation stuff to fix some capitalization and excessive spacing.
- Added the notion of countable/uncountable to the form generator so that we don't get things like "Ode to a Water" anymore (will now always be "Ode to the Water").
- Fixes to the string generation system for capitalization.
- Nation's information screen no longer displays dead people.
- Fixed bug where game would notify you of a person's death every year, every if they were already dead.

2016-05-28
Major changes:
- Added statistics to battles (projectiles launched, projectiles hit, troops lost, troops killed, et cetera).

- Improved languages so that words are more pronounceable.
- Added culture button to nation's information GUI.
- Miscellaneous message improvements.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed issue where some types of drawings would have no material.

2016-05-17
Major changes:
- Caravans now actually carrying goods from place to place (food, leather, et cetera), as well as a generic "trade goods" (so that caravans always make at least some money).
- Added fluctuating prices for goods in cities.
- Artists, writers, and composers now create works of art.

Minor changes:
- Added taverns, libraries, and caravansaries (increases the chances of sending out a caravan).
- Tweaked some building stats.
- Added a research that increases the amount of building space available.
- Decreased chance of war declarations.
- Added composers.
- Simplified date to (year, month, day) (instead of (year, month, day, hour, minute)).
